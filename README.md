# ShapeShooter

Simple shapeshooter game showing JavaFX and some animation. Semester 2 Java project.

Draw shapes on the canvas: circle, rectangle, disc. Start the animation. Start shooting. Can add shapes while the animation is running. Can also save the current state of the shapes to a binary file and reload them later.

Did't bother putting in a point system.
